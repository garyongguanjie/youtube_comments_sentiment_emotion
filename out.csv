"I was born and grew up in Singapore all my life..  I have never seen a riot,  protest or demonstration on our streets and hope to never see any ...  I just want to live a clean and peaceful life.  \n\nHowever the government needs to listen to people's feedback and concerns.  Continue to hold active & honest dialogues and conversations and consider our feedback seriously.  It's very frustrating when I send a feedback to an agency such as  SMRT only to receive a rather vague and standard response , but after many months,  nothing has been done.  \n\nIt's also frustrating when time and again,  Singaporeans like me are made to feel like 2nd class citizens in my own country when foreigners are favoured by employers.","I was born and grew up in Singapore all my life..
