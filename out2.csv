"No hater please as I‚Äôm saying in a logical point of view; you guys can disagree on what I think. We live in a free thinking world so please be use a tactful tone on your reply and no yelling with or without caps. Greatly appreciated!\n\nCovid-19 is said to be a liquid borne illness that spread through contact of human liquid excretion like mucous excretion from nose and mouth, coughing and sneezing. Judging by this, the odds of the healthier ones outside getting the virus are rather low. Unless he (she) went to visit a family with Covid-19 or contacted patients spreading around in the hospitals. The rise in the number cases should be within hospital setting and not from the people outside. Spreading from contacted patient to the healthier ones within hospital that cause the rise in the number of cases (just my theory). Wearing a useless surgical mask whenever we go out to do essential things will not really help in any matter; the only thing we get protected from is our Singapore $600 is not being fined back from the government and our oxygen getting into our lungs. I seriously don‚Äôt know about you guys but the free useless cotton mask is not practical and I hardly can breathe through it. Plus, cotton is actually the worst material and child labor is involved to harvest. Wear or don‚Äôt wear, it is pointless. \n\nI have seen the statistic of the current cases in Singapore Ministry of Health website, I agree that it is about 10,000 cases now but the fatality rate is eleven. Compare to other countries that have hundreds to thousands of death rates, this is considered rather low. I do understand that it is better to be safe than sorry. Once you come to think of it; everyone will have a stay in hospital when symptoms are shown.\n\nYoungsters and adults are crying out for some fresh air as it is really boring to stay home thirty days straight. Right now, second extension will kill all of us. It is like caging in for the crime we didn‚Äôt commit. For once, students don‚Äôt mind going to school not really because of education but they just want to get out for fresh air. I‚Äôm an introvert too and I do like to stay at home but I really want to get a job just to earn money and get some fresh air too. Staying at home is nice and all as no money is being loss unless online shopping.\n\nPrivate business owners in retail industry are facing the worst financial meltdown. In the more holistic approach to this situation, they have to retrench staff to support themselves. Thinking about others is actually out of the question. They have to pay rentals to pay for the two months, bills both at home and shop to pay and mouths to feed. Once they retrench staff, people will left unemployed with their little final salary that they last withdrawn from the company. After situation been normalized, most places most likely dare not to hire much because they are thinking about recovering the money that was loss during the two months hiatus. People will suffer as well as they can‚Äôt support basic needs for both family and oneself. Economic will not able to recline back to the ideal state for quite awhile. \n\nSafety precautions still have to take I agree. Healthier ones that are outside of the hospital zone should avoid hospital visitation at all cost for time being. Shower regularly once or twice per day. Normal without anti-bacterial cleanser is good enough. The moment you step back home for a shower should make you feel clean enough and dare not to go out anymore. Supplements like multi-vitamins and zinc should consider taking sparingly to increase your immune health. Eat more healthier and food contains higher in vitamin C and zinc content. Avoid people with similar symptoms of Covid-19. Do some home exercise to strengthen up yourself. That way you can be very sure that you are very safe from the disease. It is said that prevention is better than cure is true. Not only these recommendations I suggest will not only help you to stay healthy; it also will save you from paying hospital bill that the disease send you. \n\nIn retrospect, the media should make the situation flavourful and caused panic to everyone. Second extension is good but not good for the family‚Äôs income. They have children to feed and bills to pay. After this thing over, he will blame us for being lazy for pulling down the economics of Singapore. Either way he is making us the villain while he gains all the of being a superhero. Can we not perfect the 3 Ks of Singapore please? This is the only culture that I‚Äôm not quite proud of showing to the visitors when we resume normally.\n\nEnough said, may you guys be safe during this time of pandemic.","No hater please as Im saying in a logical point of view; you guys can disagree on what I think.

Once they retrench staff, people will left unemployed with their little final salary that they last withdrawn from the company. After situation been normalized, most places most likely dare not to hire much because they are thinking about recovering the money that was loss during the two months hiatus. People will suffer as well as they cant support basic needs for both family and oneself. Economic will not able to recline back to the ideal state for quite awhile.   Safety precautions still have to take I agree. Healthier ones that are outside of the hospital zone should avoid hospital visitation at all cost for time being. Shower regularly once or twice per day. Normal without anti-bacterial cleanser is good enough. The moment you step back home for a shower should make you feel clean enough and dare not to go out anymore. Supplements like multi-vitamins and zinc should consider taking sparingly to increase your immune health. Eat more healthier and food contains higher in vitamin C and zinc content. Avoid people with similar symptoms of Covid-19. Do some home exercise to strengthen up yourself. That way you can be very sure that you are very safe from the disease. It is said that prevention is better than cure is true. Not only these recommendations I suggest will not only help you to stay healthy; it also will save you from paying hospital bill that the disease send you.   In retrospect, the media should make the situation flavourful and caused panic to everyone. Second extension is good but not good for the familys income. They have children to feed and bills to pay. After this thing over, he will blame us for being lazy for pulling down the economics of Singapore. Either way he is making us the villain while he gains all the of being a superhero. Can we not perfect the 3 Ks of Singapore please? This is the only culture that Im not quite proud of showing to the visitors when we resume normally.  Enough said, may you guys be safe during this time of pandemic.",negative,worry
